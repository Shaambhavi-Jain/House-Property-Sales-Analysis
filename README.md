# House Property Sales Analysis

### Project Overview / Objectives 
This project applies SQL to analyze house property sales data from 2007 to 2019, to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies within the dataset through data exploration, statistical analysis, and data cleansing. Ultimately, the analysis will provide a foundation for informed data-backed decision-making in the real estate sector.

### Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/htagholdings/property-sales?select=raw_sales.csv), including the key columns:
- **date_sold**: Date of property sale
- **postcode**: Property's postal code
- **price**: Sale price of the property
- **property_type**: Type of property
- **number_of_bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms in the property

### Business Problems 
The analysis addresses a series of business questions categorized into 5 key areas:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratary Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Findings 
Some of the key findings from the analysis are:
- The most sought-after properties within the dataset comprised of 3 or 4 bedrooms, indicating a strong preference for family-sized homes.
- The median sale price of properties was determined to be $550,000, providing a benchmark for market valuation.
- The year 2018 exhibited peak property values, with a median sale price reaching $615,000, suggesting a strong market performance during that period.
- The year 2007 recorded the lowest volume of property sales, indicating a potential market downturn or economic challenges during that period.
- Approximately 39% of properties were sold above the average market value, suggesting a differentiated market with a segment of high-value properties.


### Recommendations
#### Market Focus
- The prevalence of 3 and 4 bedroom properties signals a strong demand for family homes. Consequently, tailoring the marketing and sales efforts towards families can yield substantial returns.
- The significant proportion of properties exceeding the average sale price underscores the potential profitability of the luxury market segment. By targeting high-net-worth individuals with premium properties, businesses can capitalize on this lucrative niche.

#### Investment Strategy
- A strategic investment approach should consider the 2018 peak in median sale prices as a potential benchmark for future property acquisitions. Properties acquired during this period may offer higher potential returns.
- A dynamic market necessitates continuous monitoring of market trends to identify emerging opportunities and mitigate potential risks. By maintaining a vigilant watch on market fluctuations, investors can make informed decisions and optimize their investment portfolios.

#### Sales and Marketing
- Emphasizing the availability of 3 and 4 bedroom properties can effectively target the family demographic, a key market segment.
- Highlighting the potential for property appreciation, particularly in regions with historically robust price growth, can stimulate buyer interest and drive sales.

### Future Scope
- A more in-depth analysis of factors influencing property prices, such as location, property age, and condition, can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing and investment strategies.
- Incorporating key economic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, interest rates, inflation, and consumer confidence into the analysis would enable a more comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and their impact on property values.
- Continuous monitoring of market trends is essential to identify emerging opportunities and challenges, allowing for timely adjustments in business strategies.
