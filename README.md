### Project Overview / Objectives 
This project applies SQL to analyze house property sales data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies within the dataset through data exploration, statistical analysis, and data cleansing. Ultimately, the analysis will provide a foundation for informed data-backed decision-making in the real estate sector.
